tgrep
=====

tgrep is a log-file grepping utility which makes use of binary search.
It assumes a log-file with its timestamps ordered by date, ascending.

It also assumes the timestamps have a fixed length.

At the moment this is just some fooling around, no command line
interface / configuration possibilities yet.
